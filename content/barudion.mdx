## Goal

I built Barudion with two primary goals. First, to provide active investors with robust, intuitive market
indicators, covering stocks, bonds, and commodities, helping them manage diversified portfolios. Second, we aim to
teach programming enthusiasts how to replicate our strategies with Python, offering both basic and advanced methods
in quantitative finance.

## Challenges

A major challenge was integrating user management and subscriptions with Stripe, ensuring smooth transactions.
When real money is involved the implementation has to be robust so users do not loose access to features they already
paid for.

The project also needs seamless data integration between the python backend and the js frontend.
The backend uses advanced data processing libraries like pandas, numpy and bayesloop and the frontend needs custom
data visualisation tools to communicate the data to the customer.

I wrote a custom plotting library for this purpose to one the one hand reproduce matplotlib-like graphs on  the frontend
but still have extended interactivity for the user in the browser.


## Implementation

Our dynamic portfolios are built with Bayesian statistics, adjusting weekly to market changes. Users can follow along
by replicating these strategies with our built-in tools. The platform also includes a Python course for those
interested in coding their own algorithms, making quantitative finance more accessible to a wider audience.
