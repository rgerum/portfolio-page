## Goal

Observing Emperor Penguins in Antarctica is a challenging and time-consuming task
as the interesting huddling behaviour can only be observed during the harsh weather conditions
of the Antarctic winter.

Wherefore, we build a remote controlled penguin observatory (**S**ingle **P**enguin **O**bervation and
**T**racking SPOT) to record footage of
penguins without the need to be there on the ice in Atka Bay.
Using a satellite link and a Wi-Fi bridge the
observatory can be controlled out of our lab in Germany.

## Implementation

My task was mainly to implement the web-based interface to control the observatory.
The challenging part here was that it should work robust even with an unstable and slow
internet connection. Furthermore, the code should be as simple as possible to ensure stability and
future maintainability, as debugging during the season is extremely difficult due to the high latencies.

## Interface

The backend is made using a python flask server that connects to the cameras of the observatory.
The observatory consists of 7 surveillance cameras that together give a panoramic overview over the bay and
one high resolution camera on a pan-and-tilt unit with video capabilities.

The frontend written mainly in vanilla JS to keep the complexity down, shows the current pictures form the
surveillance cameras and allows to select a position on one of their images to move the high-resolution camera
with the pan-and-tilt unit to the target location.
