Goal
----

**Duolingo** offers format of short stories in some of their
courses, but not all. I wanted to change that.

Duostories is a **community effort** to translate these stories
to more languages.

We have currently translated over **2000** stories in over 
**70** for our
**5k** registered users.

Challenges
----------
To create this community project, it first required me to reverse engineer how the data is loaded in the website of
Duolingo, so I could scrape the stories date from the website. To be able to use their material in a legal way I needed
to contact them and negotiate a license agreement.

Then a big challenge was to select the tech stack to use for this project. My first attempts to use a **LAMP** server
with a **PHP** backend and a **mysql** database got a first prototype running quickly, but I realized that in order to
keep the app maintainable. I need to upgrade to a more modern stack. Therefore, I transitioned first to a **React** frontend
and a **node.js** express backend, but finally settled on a **next.js** stack which includes frontend and backend in a
smooth way with React server components. From the initial **mysql** database I switched to **postgres** as it has more
advanced features, for storing arrays of json objects.

Hosting the project was another major challenge. I started with a rented server where I had to take care of all the
devops tasks to keep things running. But without a big team this provided quite challenging, therefore I switched to a
hosted service "vercel".

Growing and maintaining the community provided another great challenge. Initially I used the Duolingo forum to communicate
with contributors and users, but had to move to Discord as the Duolingo forum closed. With an active Twitter and
Instagram account for the project I keep advertising for the project.

Duolingo Approved
-----------------
I negotiated with Duolingo a special **license** to cover our
project and allow use to use their material.

Duolingo Founder and CEO **Luis von Ahn** himself signed this
license on which this project is based.

AI driven speech
----------------
To provide the **best learning experience** Duostories provides
audio for the stories.

For a consistent and reliable audio experience Duostories integrates 
**text-to-speech** (TTS) services from various providers.

Why various and not just a single one? As Duostories is aimed to
cover as many languages as possible we need to take advantage of
multiple providers.

Currently, we use **Google**, **Amazon**, 
**Microsoft** and **Eleven Labs**

Easy Editing
------------

Stories are not just simple texts as they include 
**interactive exercises**, **translation tooltips** and
**audio**.

To keep the editing experience as smooth as possible I developed a
specially tailored markup language to represent the stories.

A **codemirror** based editor with a synchronized live preview
makes editing a breeze.

Welcoming Community
-------------------
To ensure good quality of translations into as many languages as
possible. Duostories relies on a big group of contributors managed
in our **Discord Community**.

Our automatic Discord bot helps with the onboarding of new members
and gives them access to the editor once they are approved.

Our quality control system ensures that only stories approved my the
community are published.
