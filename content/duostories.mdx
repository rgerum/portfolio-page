Goal
----

**Duolingo** offers format of short stories in some of their
courses, but not all. I wanted to change that.

Duostories is a **community effort** to translate these stories
to more languages.

We have currently translated over **2000** stories in over 
**70** for our
**5k** registered users.

Duolingo Approved
-----------------
I negotiated with Duolingo a special **license** to cover our
project and allow use to use their material.

Duolingo Founder and CEO **Luis von Ahn** himself signed this
license on which this project is based.

AI driven speech
----------------
To provide the **best learning experience** Duostories provides
audio for the stories.

For a consistent and reliable audio experience Duostories integrates 
**text-to-speech** (TTS) services from various providers.

Why various and not just a single one? As Duostories is aimed to
cover as many languages as possible we need to take advantage of
multiple providers.

Currently, we use **Google**, **Amazon**, 
**Microsoft** and **Eleven Labs**

Easy Editing
------------

Stories are not just simple texts as they include 
**interactive exercises**, **translation tooltips** and
**audio**.

To keep the editing experience as smooth as possible I developed a
specially tailored markup language to represent the stories.

A **codemirror** based editor with a synchronized live preview
makes editing a breeze.

Welcoming Community
-------------------
To ensure good quality of translations into as many languages as
possible. Duostories relies on a big group of contributors managed
in our **Discord Community**.

Our automatic Discord bot helps with the onboarding of new members
and gives them access to the editor once they are approved.

Our quality control system ensures that only stories approved my the
community are published.
