## Goal

Producing high quality figures ready for publication can be quite challenging. Python libraries like Matplotib offer
great possibilities, but it is very difficult to define a complex layout in code. Therefore, often image editing software
(e.g. Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, etc.) is used to compose the plots into a figure.
This workflow is error-prone as data can be accidentally modified and tedious if data needs to be updated.

To solve this problem I developed Pylustrator and interactive plot editor directly on top of Matplotlib. The changes to
the figure are saved as python code, so changing the underlying data or reproducing the plot is a breeze.

## Implementation

Just adding two lines of code to your plotting code opens the plot in Pylustrator instead of the Matplotlib window, by
monkey patching the Matplotlib functions.

```python
import pylustrator
pylustrator.start()
```
When loading the interface Pylustrator parses from calling python file Pylustrator's previous changes. All user
interactions are recorded and when saving merged together and joined with the previous changes.

The code that Pylustrator generates is pure Matplotlib code, so it can be shipped without Pylustrator as a dependency.

## Interface

The user interface is designed using **Qt** which embeds the matplotlib plot. As the matplotlib plot's rendering can
slow for large plots, QtGraphicsView is used as an overlay of the plot to create more fluent user interactions.
