## Goal

Producing high quality figures ready for publication can be quite challenging. Python libraries like Matplotib offer
great possibilities, but it is very difficult to define a complex layout in code. Therefore, often image editing software
(e.g. Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, etc.) is used to compose the plots into a figure.
This workflow is error-prone as data can be accidentally modified and tedious if data needs to be updated.

To solve this problem I developed Pylustrator and interactive plot editor directly on top of Matplotlib. The changes to
the figure are saved as python code, so changing the underlying data or reproducing the plot is a breeze.
