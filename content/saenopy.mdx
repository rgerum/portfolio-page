Goal
----

Measuring force generation of cells in natural environments is
essential to understand e.g. tissue healing, tumor metastasis, and
immune responses.

Saenopy allows to measure these forces in a naturalistic 3D collagen
environment.

Implementation
--------------

The force reconstruction is based on a
**Finite Element Solver** original developed by
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.3685">Steinwachs et al.</a>
The volume is approximated by a grid of tetrahedral elements.

Each element is represented by a non-linear stiffness function
representing the fibers of the material.

Heavy calculations are done using **Numpy** vectorization and
**Numba** jit-compilation.

Interface & Visualization
-------------------------

A clear and easy to use interface using **Qt** guides the user
through the process and allows to use the software without
specialized knowledge of the algorithm.

I see **visual feedback** as a key element to make sure the
user understands what the software is doing and can spot errors.

Therefore, Saenopy is no black box. Every intermediate step is
visualized in an interactive way using **VTK**.

Data
----

Cells are embedded in a 3D collagen matrix and imaged using a{" "}
**confocal microscope** with reflection mode. A contrast mode
that visualizes the fibers.

A stack of images is recorded before and after relaxing the cell
with a drug.

Deformations
------------

Deformations are calculated using a
**3D particle image velocimetry (PIV)** algorithm.

This algorithm uses a 3D cross-correlation to find a match of the
"relaxed" image stack in the "deformed" image
stack.


Forces
------

The calculation of the forces from the deformations is the core part
of saenopy.

The iterative algorithm tries to reconstruct the forces in the
non-linear material. Tikhonov regularization ensure forces do not
diverge.
